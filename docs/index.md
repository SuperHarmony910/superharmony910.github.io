# Welcome to SuperHarmony910's GitHub profile

I am a young, ambitious and mostly self-motivated programmer who is currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, C and C++.

## Why do I code  

My desire to commit to open source code was first motivated by [@MrCrayfish](https://github.com/MrCrayfish), who was at the time moddding for Minecraft! You can learn about why and how I started to code for Minecraft [here](https://superharmony910.github.io/modification-builder)!
